# New Hire Orientation
Congratulations and welcome to Phlogiston Computers Ltd, successful candidates! As you may already know, Phlogiston Microcomputers Ltd (PML) is a Toronto based home computer company founded last year, in 1975. The MOS 6502 had recently been released, which we believe is opening up a new era of computing. At the rate we're moving, expect to see a microcomputer in every home by 1980. By 1990, the virtual world will be so advanced that it will be indistinguishable from reality. By the new millennium, entire cities will have microprocessor implants to improve beyond our natural abilities, or augmented reality headsets that help us percieve the world in ways we can't even imagine today!

.. and as an engineer at PML, YOU are participating in building that future!

# Vitrify

Vitrify is a programming language currently being developed for the Phlogiston Series I. It is being designed to allow programmers to take full advantage of the 6502 processor like some lower level assemblers, but provides higher level language constructs that can be used interchangeably, such as structs (a named collection of values), array syntax (contiguous word access), and more user friendly subroutine call syntax.

See the `vitrify` subdirectory to access the project.
